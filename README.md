# Survey-Data-Helper
This script is designed to aggregate multiple individual surveys and add them all to an existing spreadsheet that includes all responses up until now. 

# Why this script is useful
I starting working with a large scale counseling education research study when I noticed they were paying graduate students to manually and painstakingly enter over 30 hours worth of survey responses into SPSS every week! The surveys were electronic, but due to no centralized database or software, and history being kept in spreadsheets, they were forced to add all data to this existing spreadsheet. I saw this as a golden opportunity to save the project loads of money, relieve graduate students of painful data entry, and also improve the overall accuracy of the data set -- because human error is eliminated.

# What exactly does it do
This program is designed to aggregate survey results in a very specific survey format. Since they were using the exact survey format each week for consistency, this script is designed specifically to detect their survey format and add each participant's responses to the database. The main complexity in this script was that some participants were returning (meaning multiple survey responses) so I was required to add to their current entry in the spreadsheet instead of creating a new entry in the sheet.

# Future of this script
After I wrote the code I showed them exactly how to use it and wrote them an instruction guide on using it. As of February 2020, they have been using this code for over two years now!
